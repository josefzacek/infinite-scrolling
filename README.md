# Page scrolling
3 ways to load more records from database

Demo available at [https://infinite-scrolling.herokuapp.com/](https://infinite-scrolling.herokuapp.com/)

## Infinite Scrolling
Loads new records as user scrolls down

## Load more button
Loads more records on click of button at the bottom of page

## Paginate
Traditional pagination at the bottom of page

---


## Gems used

* `gem 'will_paginate'`

* `gem 'bootstrap-sass'`

* `gem 'bootstrap-will_paginate'`

* `gem 'slim'`

* `gem 'faker'`

* `gem 'query_diet'`

## Gem removed

* `gem 'turbolinks'`

**NOTE:** I have tried multiple ways to get **Infinite Scrolling** and **Load more button** pages working with Turbolinks without refreshing page which seemed to be unsuccessful.

Removing **Turbolinks** was the only (**temporary**) option to fix this problem.
